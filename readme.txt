Displays a random Amazon link box from a list of asin product ids.

== Description ==
A sidebar widget for an amazon product link. It will randomly display one product from a list of products in the sidebar every time a new wordpress page is displayed. Useful for displaying one link from a list of Amazon products.

== Installation ==
1. Download the plugin.
2. Upload the plugin to your wp-content/plugins directory.
3. Activate the plugin.
4. Drag widget to your sidebar.
5. Enter Title, Your Amazon Affiliate ID (affid), and a list of Amazon product ASIN numbers.
If you do not enter the amazon affiliate ID it uses mine, so you had better sign up with Amazon before using this widget if you want to make money. 

If you are upgrading from a previous version make sure that you go to the widget configuration to check your affiliate Id and list of asins.
